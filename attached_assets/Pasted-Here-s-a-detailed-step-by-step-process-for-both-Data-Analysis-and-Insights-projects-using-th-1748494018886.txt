## 🔍 Project 2.1: Autonomous Market Trend Analyzer

### 🧠 Objective
Fetch and analyze financial/social data and summarize market trends or investment insights.

### 👥 Agents Involved
- **Data Fetcher Agent** – Scrapes/collects financial news and stock data.
- **Sentiment Analyzer Agent** – Evaluates the tone of news data.
- **Insight Summarizer Agent** – Writes trend summaries and predictions.

### 🛠 GCP Tools
- BigQuery
- Cloud Functions
- Cloud Storage

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Enable BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage.
   - Prepare datasets or APIs for real-time financial and news data.

2. **Data Fetcher Agent**
   - Sources: RSS feeds, APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Google News).
   - Output: Structured data (headlines, stock prices).
   - Store in Cloud Storage or BigQuery for access.

3. **Sentiment Analyzer Agent**
   - Input: News headlines/articles.
   - Task: Use NLP models to classify sentiment (positive/neutral/negative).
   - Tools: Pretrained Vertex AI models or custom sentiment classifier.

4. **Insight Summarizer Agent**
   - Input: Sentiment scores + stock movements.
   - Output: Narrative summaries (e.g., “Tech stocks show bullish trend this week.”).
   - Tools: Vertex AI or GPT models for summarization.

5. **Automation via Cloud Functions**
   - Trigger analysis daily or weekly.
   - Or allow user input to initiate custom trend reports.

6. **Deliverables**
   - Market sentiment report (PDF/HTML).
   - Data and report stored in Cloud Storage.
   - Optional dashboard integration.

## 📈 Project 2.2: Sales Data Insight Generator

### 🧠 Objective
Analyze e-commerce or retail sales data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and generate reports.

### 👥 Agents Involved
- **Data Aggregator Agent** – Collects and merges sales data.
- **Anomaly Detector Agent** – Detects unusual sales patterns.
- **Report Builder Agent** – Generates visual and textual reports.

### 🛠 GCP Tools
- BigQuery
- Looker (for visualization)
- Vertex AI (for analysis)

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Process

1. **Set Up GCP Environment**
   - Enable BigQuery, Looker, Vertex AI.
   - Load e-commerce sales data into BigQuery.

2. **Data Aggregator Agent**
   - Task: Aggregate sales by region, category, time.
   - Run SQL queries using BigQuery API.
   - Output: Clean, structured tables.

3. **Anomaly Detector Agent**
   - Input: Aggregated sales data.
   - Task: Detect sudden spikes/drops in sales or traffic.
   - Tools: Vertex AI (AutoML anomaly detection or custom ML model).

4. **Report Builder Agent**
   - Input: Aggregated data + anomalies.
   - Task: Generate charts and written summaries.
   - Tools:
     - Charts: Looker or Python (matplotlib/seaborn)
     - Text: Vertex AI for automatic summary

5. **Combine & Deliver**
   - Create a PDF or dashboard with sales KPIs, anomalies, and summaries.
   - Automate weekly report generation using scheduled Cloud Functions.

6. **Deliverables**
   - Sales Insight Report (PDF, HTML, or Looker dashboard)
   - BigQuery dataset
   - Automated agent system built with ADK
